# docker-phan

An installation of PHP7 and [Phan][phan] in a super tiny [Alpine Linux][alpine]
Docker image. The image is just 17 MB and runs interactively on the files
outside your container, making it easy to statically analyze PHP code.

[phan/docker](https://github.com/phan/docker) is a fork of [cloudflare/docker-phan](cloudflare-docker-phan)

## Motivations

Phan requires PHP7.2+ and specific PHP extensions to be installed. PHP7.2+ isn’t
packaged yet for many Linux distributions and users would still need to compile
and enable the extra PHP extensions.

By packaging Phan inside a Docker image, we can separate the runtime and
configuration of the tool from your application’s environment and requirements.

## Getting docker-phan

The easiest way to use `docker-phan` is to create a shell function for “phan”
that makes makes it nearly transparent that phan is running inside Docker.

```sh
phan() { docker run -v $PWD:/mnt/src --rm -u "$(id -u):$(id -g)" phanphp/phan:latest $@; return $?; }
```

(You may replace “latest” with a tagged Phan release to use a specific version
of Phan.)

## Running docker-phan
> If you’re just getting started with Phan, you should follow Phan’s excellent
[Tutorial for Analyzing A Large Sloopy Code Base][phan-tutorial] to setup the
initial configuration for your project.

All of Phan’s command line flags can be passed to `docker-phan`.

## Example

To create an “analysis.txt” in the current directory for farther processing

``` sh
phan -po analysis.txt
```

## Building

Docker images are built with the `build` script based on the awesome building
and testing framework put into place by the [`docker-alpine`][docker-alpine]
contributors. See [BUILD.md][build-docs] for more information.
